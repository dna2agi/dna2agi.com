            <p>Modeling the comprehensive pathway from DNA to proteins, cells, organisms, and ultimately to intelligent organisms in a single framework is an extraordinarily complex task. It requires integrating knowledge from molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, evolutionary theory, and artificial intelligence. While there are models and simulations that focus on specific aspects of this pathway (such as genetic algorithms, protein folding simulations, or neural network evolution), a holistic model that encompasses all these levels is a monumental challenge and does not yet exist, yet.</p>
            <p>This is primarily due to the vast differences in scale and complexity at each level, from the molecular interactions within DNA to the emergent behaviors of intelligent organisms. Integrating these disparate levels into a single model requires not just a deep understanding of each individual process, but also how they interact and influence each other over evolutionary timescales.</p>
            <p>It is dna2agi's mission to walk down this pathway and build incredible software systems inspired from this perspective.</p>
            <p>This walk is on an audacious, unconventional, and perhaps foolish path to artificial general intelligence (AGI). It is also the only proven path to general intelligence known so far. Just ask a dolphin.</p>
